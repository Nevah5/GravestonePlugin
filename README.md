# GravestonePlugin - Nevah5

## Idea

I created this plugin for a server where I play with my friends. Loosing your items is pain, when you also play
NotSoHardcore. This game mode removes a heart when you die.

## How it works

If you die the plugin spawns a bedrock, that the player that died can right click to claim his items. If a block is not
air, it tries to spawn it a block higher, etc.
If no air block is found to world height, the plugin also tries to spawn it to bedrock level.

If the grave somehow can't spawn, the items just drop on the ground.

So you are saved from falling into the void, dying in lava, creeper explosions, and many other ways to die.
